# Greater Canberra Website

A site I built for my local housing advocacy group Greater Canberra.
I forked the site here when I handed the product over to the group's organisers.

I made a Figma prototype, ran user testing including task completion and IA sorting with a few volunteers, then built the site using Astro and Netlify. I plugged on the Netlify CMS so the organisation could keep publishing on their shiny new website.

Hereâ€™s the [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/fTYTcuO8nO0DJtkZu6gTLl/Greater-Canberra?node-id=0%3A1).
